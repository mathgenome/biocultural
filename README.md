This repossitory is associatted to the paper AN INFORMATION THEORY APPROACH TO BIOCULTURAL COMPLEXITY, in review process.

Script author: M. Humberto Reyes-Valdés

### Script for biocultural complexity

The script biocultural.R contains functions to calculate taxa specificity, culture specialization and biocultural complexity

### Data

*toyset.csv* is a small invented data set to show the use of the functions.

*datMushroomComplete.csv* was taken from published results for wild mushroom usage. It includes counts for 18 mushroom species, in terms of their usage in five villages of the eastern lateritic part of India. Reference:
